# Serverless Functions in NodeJS

This directory contains samples of serverless functions written in NodeJS to help you get started on [boltic.io](https://www/boltic.io)

It is divided into two main sections:

- [**Buildpacks**](buildpack/README.md): These are functions built using the open source [Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io/). Buildpacks are ideal for building and deploying functions quickly and easily without explicitly defining dependencies or configurations

- [**Docker**](docker/README.md): These are functions built using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Dockerfile is ideal for building and deploying functions with more control over dependencies and configurations
