# Java Samples

This directory contains samples of serverless functions and application written in Java 11 to help you get started on [boltic.io](https://www/boltic.io)

It is divided into two main sections:

- [**Functions**](functions/README.md): These are standalone snippets of code that you can deploy individually on Boltic. Functions are ideal for automating repetitive tasks, such as sending emails or collecting data.

- [**Applications**](applications/README.md): These are complete applications that you can deploy on Boltic. Applications are ideal for more complex tasks, such as building a blog or a todo list.
